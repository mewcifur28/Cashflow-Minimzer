# Cashflow-Minimzer
Cashflow minimization algorithm implemented in C++

# About
Cash flow minimization algorithm takes input as a bunch of transactions.
For example 
- a -> b +20
- b -> c +30
- b -> d + 15
- c -> a +50

Now 
a owes b 20
b owes c 30
b owes d 15
c owes a 50

These transactions can be minimized using graph algorithms
and simple greedy algorithms
